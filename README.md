adminbootstraptheme
===================

A theme for the Alaveteli admin interface that uses Twitter's
Bootstrap project to prettify it.  It depends on (and is the default
admin theme for) Alaveteli verion 0.6 or above.

If you want to work on the CSS, you'll want to use
[bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass). Do something like:


    $ gem install bootstrap-sass
    $ gem install compass
    $ compass compile --config .compass/config.rb
