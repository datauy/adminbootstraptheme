adminbootstraptheme
===================

A theme for the Alaveteli admin interface that uses Twitter's Bootstrap project to prettify it.

If you want to work on the CSS, you'll want to use
[bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass). Do something like:


    $ gem install bootstrap-sass
    $ gem install compass
    $ compass compile --config .compass/config.rb
